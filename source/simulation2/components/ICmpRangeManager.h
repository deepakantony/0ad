/**
 * Provides efficient range-based queries of the game world,
 * and also LOS-based effects (fog of war).
 *
 * (These are somewhat distinct concepts but they share a lot of the implementation,
 * so for efficiency they're combined into this class.)
 *
 * Possible use cases:
 * - combat units need to detect targetable enemies entering LOS, so they can choose
 *   to auto-attack.
 * - auras let a unit have some effect on all units (or those of the same player, or of enemies)
 *   within a certain range.
 * - capturable animals need to detect when a player-owned unit is nearby and no units of other
 *   players are in range.
 * - scenario triggers may want to detect when units enter a given area.
 * - units gathering from a resource that is exhausted need to find a new resource of the
 *   same type, near the old one and reachable.
 * - projectile weapons with splash damage need to find all units within some distance
 *   of the target point.
 * - ...
 *
 * In most cases the users are event-based and want notifications when something
 * has entered or left the range, and the query can be set up once and rarely changed.
 * These queries have to be fast. It's fine to approximate an entity as a point.
 *
 * Current design:
 *
 * This class handles just the most common parts of range queries:
 * distance, target interface, and player ownership.
 * The caller can then apply any more complex filtering that it needs.
 *
 * There are two types of query:
 * Passive queries are performed by ExecuteQuery and immediately return the matching entities.
 * Active queries are set up by CreateActiveQuery, and then a CMessageRangeUpdate message will be
 * sent to the entity once per turn if anybody has entered or left the range since the last RangeUpdate.
 * Queries can be disabled, in which case no message will be sent.
